# Ending thoughts

Things that i wish i had more time to do:

1) Add Redux to this. I don't like how messy sending props down to individual components can get. I believe the organization of this project would be better if we had 
some kind of state management like redux.

2) Add unit tests. I hope this one is self explanatory, but testing is always good. I prefer Jest / Enzyme.

3) Add comments to the files.

4) Prettier and EsLint weren't working on my machine, but i would've liked to format my code and make it neater.

5) Use typescript instead of javascript. I think typescript is better for shared code as it makes it easier to read and infer what data / datatypes you are dealing with.

6) Use more functional components. I'm not as comfortable with functional components than class components, but now with hooks, functional components are just as good.

Functionality to add:

1) export to PDF / excel on selected flight rotation

2) view all selected flight rotation in a nice view (grid or table view)
