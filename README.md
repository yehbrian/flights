# Ending thoughts

Things that i wish i had more time to do:

1) Add Redux to this. I don't like how messy sending props down to individual components can get. I believe the organization of this project would be better if we had 
some kind of state management like redux.

2) add unit tests. I hope this one is self explanatory, but testing is always good.

3) Add comments to the file

4) Prettier and EsLint weren't working on my machine, but i would've liked to format my code and make it neater.

Functionality to add:

1) export to PDF / excel on selected flight rotation

2) view all selected flight rotation in a nice view (grid or table view)
